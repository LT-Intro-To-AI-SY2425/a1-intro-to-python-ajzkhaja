# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?

I think python is an interesting programming language. It is much easier than Java because you don't need extra code to do a simple task. 

2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?

Some similarities are that you need to have almost everything in quotation marks and parenthesis. Some differences are that you don't need as much code when writing python. For example, you don't need a ";" at the end of a line of code. However, in Java you would need this. 



3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?

I learned how to assign a variable and call/print it vertically and horizontally in the terminal. In other words, print it in a straght line or print it in columns.
